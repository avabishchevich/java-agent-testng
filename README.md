# Zebrunner TestNG (7.3.0) agent
Official Zebrunner TestNG agent providing reporting and smart reruns functionality. No special configuration is required to enable the Zebrunner Listener for TestNG - service discovery mechanism will automatically register listener as soon as it becomes available on the classpath of your test project.

## Inclusion into your project 
The agent comes bundled with TestNG 7.3.0, so you may want to comment out or exclude your TestNG dependency from the project. If you are using a version of TestNG below 7.3.0, we cannot guarantee that the agent's functionality will work correctly.

Including the agent into your project is very straight forward - just add the dependency to the build descriptor.

## Agent configuration
Once agent is available on classpath of your test project, it is **not** automatically enabled and expects a valid configuration to be available.

It is currently possible to provide the configuration via:
1. Environment variables 
2. Program arguments 
3. YAML file
4. Properties file

Configuration lookup will be performed in order listed above, meaning environment configuration will always take precedence over YAML and so on.
It is also possible to override configuration parameters by passing them through a configuration provider having higher precedence.

Once configuration is in place, agent is ready to track you test run events, no additional configuration required.

### Environment configuration
The following configuration parameters are recognized by the agent:

- `REPORTING_ENABLED` - enables or disables reporting. Default value is `false`. If disabled - agent will use no op component implementations that will simply log output for tracing purpose with `trace` level;
- `REPORTING_SERVER_HOSTNAME` - mandatory if reporting is enabled. Zebrunner server hostname. Can be obtained in Zebrunner on the 'Account & profile' page under 'Service URL' section;
- `REPORTING_SERVER_ACCESS_TOKEN` - mandatory if reporting is enabled. Access token to be used to perform API calls. Can be obtained in Zebrunner on the 'Account & profile' page under 'Token' section;
- `REPORTING_PROJECT_KEY` - optional value. The project that the test runs belongs to. Default value is `UNKNOWN`. You can manage projects in Zebrunner in the appropriate section.
- `REPORTING_RUN_DISPLAY_NAME` - optional value. The display name of the test run. Default value is `Default Suite`;
- `REPORTING_RUN_BUILD` - optional value. The build number that is associated with the test run. It can depict either the test build number, or the application build number;
- `REPORTING_RUN_ENVIRONMENT` - optional value. The environment in which the tests will run.

### Program arguments configuration
The following configuration parameters are recognized by the agent:

- `reporting.enabled` - enables or disables reporting. Default value is `false`. If disabled - agent will use no op component implementations that will simply log output for tracing purpose with `trace` level;
- `reporting.server.hostname` - mandatory if reporting is enabled. Zebrunner server hostname. Can be obtained in Zebrunner on the 'Account & profile' page under 'Service URL' section;
- `reporting.server.accessToken` - mandatory if reporting is enabled. Access token to be used to perform API calls. Can be obtained in Zebrunner on the 'Account & profile' page under 'Token' section;
- `reporting.projectKey` - optional value. The project that the test runs belongs to. Default value is `UNKNOWN`. You can manage projects in Zebrunner in the appropriate section.
- `reporting.run.displayName` - optional value. The display name of the test run. Default value is `Default Suite`;
- `reporting.run.build` - optional value. The build number that is associated with the test run. It can depict either the test build number, or the application build number;
- `reporting.run.environment` - optional value. The environment in which the tests will run.

### YAML configuration
Agent recognizes `agent.yaml` or `agent.yml` file residing in resources root folder. It is currently not possible to configure alternative file location.

Below is a sample configuration file:

```yaml
reporting:
  enabled: true
  project-key: UNKNOWN
  server:
    hostname: localhost:8080
    access-token: <token>
  run:
    display-name: Nightly Regression Suite
    build: 1.12.1.96-SNAPSHOT
    environment: TEST-1
```

- `reporting.enabled` - enables or disables reporting. Default value is `false`. If disabled - agent will use no op component implementations that will simply log output for tracing purpose with `trace` level;
- `reporting.server.hostname` - mandatory if reporting is enabled. Zebrunner server hostname. Can be obtained in Zebrunner on the 'Account & profile' page under 'Service URL' section;
- `reporting.server.access-token` - mandatory if reporting is enabled. Access token to be used to perform API calls. Can be obtained in Zebrunner on the 'Account & profile' page under 'Token' section;
- `reporting.project-key` - optional value. The project that the test runs belongs to. Default value is `UNKNOWN`. You can manage projects in Zebrunner in the appropriate section.
- `reporting.run.display-name` - optional value. The display name of the test run. Default value is `Default Suite`;
- `reporting.run.build` - optional value. The build number that is associated with the test run. It can depict either the test build number, or the application build number;
- `reporting.run.environment` - optional value. The environment in which the tests will run.

### Properties configuration
Agent recognizes only `agent.properties` file residing in resources root folder. It is currently not possible to configure alternative file location.

Below is a sample configuration file:

```properties
reporting.enabled=true
reporting.project-key=UNKNOWN
reporting.server.hostname=localhost:8080
reporting.server.access-token=<token>
reporting.run.display-name=Nightly Regression Suite
reporting.run.build=1.12.1.96-SNAPSHOT
reporting.run.environment=TEST-1
```

- `reporting.enabled` - enables or disables reporting. Default value is `false`. If disabled - agent will use no op component implementations that will simply log output for tracing purpose with `trace` level;
- `reporting.server.hostname` - mandatory if reporting is enabled. Zebrunner server hostname. Can be obtained in Zebrunner on the 'Account & profile' page under 'Service URL' section;
- `reporting.server.access-token` - mandatory if reporting is enabled. Access token to be used to perform API calls. Can be obtained in Zebrunner on the 'Account & profile' page under 'Token' section;
- `reporting.project-key` - optional value. The project that the test runs belongs to. Default value is `UNKNOWN`. You can manage projects in Zebrunner in the appropriate section.

- `reporting.run.environment` - optional value. The environment in which the tests will run.

## Advanced reporting
It is possible to configure additional reporting capabilities improving your tracking experience.

### Collecting test logs
It is also possible to enable log collection for your tests. Currently, three logging frameworks are supported out of the box: logback, log4j, log4j2. We recommend to use slf4j (Simple Logging Facade for Java) which provides abstraction over logging libraries.
In order to enable logging all you have to do is register reporting appender in your test framework configuration file.

#### Logback
Add logback (and, optionally, slf4j) dependencies to your build descriptor.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Gradle**
```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.30'
  implementation 'ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.2.3'
  implementation 'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.3'
}
```
#### **Maven**
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.7.30</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
        <artifactId>logback-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
        <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.3</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

Add logging appender in `logback.xml` file. Feel free to customize the logging pattern according to your needs:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <appender name="ZebrunnerAppender" class="com.zebrunner.agent.core.appender.logback.ReportingAppender">
       <encoder>
          <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level - %msg%n</pattern>
       </encoder>
    </appender>
    <root level="info">
        <appender-ref ref="ZebrunnerAppender" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

#### Log4j
Add log4j (and, optionally, slf4j) dependency to your build descriptor.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Gradle**
```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.30'
  implementation 'log4j:log4j:1.2.17'
}
```

        <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.17</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

Add logging appender in `log4j.properties` file. Feel free to customize the logging pattern according to your needs:
```properties
log4j.rootLogger = INFO, zebrunner
log4j.appender.zebrunner=com.zebrunner.agent.core.appender.log4j.ReportingAppender
log4j.appender.zebrunner.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.zebrunner.layout.conversionPattern=pattern">[%d{HH:mm:ss}] %-5p (%F:%L) - %m%n
```

#### Log4j2
Add log4j2 (and, optionally, slf4j) dependency to your build descriptor:

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Gradle**
```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.30'
  implementation 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:2.13.3'
  implementation 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.13.3'
}
```
#### **Maven**
```xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.7.30</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>log4j-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.13.3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
        <version>2.13.3</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

Add logging appender in `log4j2.xml` file. Feel free to customize the logging pattern according to your needs:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration packages="com.zebrunner.agent.core.appender.log4j2">
   <properties>
      <property name="pattern">[%d{HH:mm:ss}] %-5p (%F:%L) - %m%n</property>
   </properties>
   <appenders>
      <ZebrunnerAppender name="ZebrunnerAppender">
         <PatternLayout pattern="${pattern}" />
      </ZebrunnerAppender>
   </appenders>
   <loggers>
      <root level="info">
         <appender-ref ref="ZebrunnerAppender"/>
      </root>
   </loggers>
</configuration>
```

#### Logger usage
No additional steps are required to collect test logs and track them in Zebrunner.
```java
import java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class AwesomeTests {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());

    @Test
    public void awesomeTest() {
        LOGGER.info("Test info");
    }

}
```

### Capturing screenshots
In case you are using TestNG as a UI testing framework it might come handy to have an ability to track captured screenshots in scope of Zebrunner reporting.
Agent comes with a Java API allowing you to send your screenshots to Zebrunner, so they will be attached to test.

Below is a sample code of test sending screenshot to Zebrunner:
```java
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.registrar.Screenshot;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class AwesomeTests {

    @Test
    public void myAwesomeTest() {
        byte[] screenshotBytes = // capture screenshot
        Screenshot.upload(screenshotBytes, capturedAtMillis);
        // meaningful assertions
    }

}
```

Screenshot should be passed as byte array along with unix timestamp in milliseconds corresponding to the moment when screenshot was captured. 
If `null` is supplied instead of timestamp - it will be generated automatically, however it is recommended to use an accurate timestamp in order to get accurate tracking.

The uploaded screenshot will appear among test logs. The actual position depends on the provided (or generated) timestamp.

### Saving artifacts
In case your tests produce some artifacts, it might be useful to track them in Zebrunner. Agent comes with a few convenient methods for uploading artifacts in Zebrunner and linking them to the currently running test.

Artifact can be uploaded using the `Artifact` class. This class has 4 static methods to upload artifact represented by any Java type associated with files. Together with an artifact, you must provide the artifact name. This name must contain the file extension  that reflects the actual content of the file. If the file extension is incorrect, this file will not be saved in Zebrunner.

Here is a sample test:
```java
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Path;

import com.zebrunner.agent.core.registrar.Artifact;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class AwesomeTests {

    @Test
    public void awesomeTest() {
        // some code here
        InputStream inputStream;
        byte[] byteArray;
        File file;
        Path path;
        Artifact.upload(inputStream, "file.docx");
        Artifact.upload(byteArray, "image.png");
        Artifact.upload(file, "application.apk");
        Artifact.upload(path, "test-log.txt");
        // meaningful assertions
    }

}
```
Artifact upload process is performed in background, so it will not affect test execution.
The uploaded artifacts will appear under the test name in run results in Zebrunner.

It is also allowed to attach links on external artifacts. It might be any kind of external resource. In order to attach any external artifacts, you should use static method of the `ArtifactReference` class.

Here is an example:
```java
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.registrar.ArtifactReference;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class AwesomeTests {

    @Test
    public void awesomeTest() {
        // some code here
        ArtifactReference.attach("Zebrunner", "https://zebrunner.com/");
        // meaningful assertions
    }

}
```
The example above adds a link on zebrunner.com to the list of test artifacts.

### Attaching labels
In some cases it might be useful to attach some meta information related to test. This information can describe anything related to test - it's Jira id, it's priority, or any other useful data.

The agent comes with a concept of label. Label is a key-value pair associated with test. The key is represented by a `String`, the label value accepts a vararg of `Strings`. 

There is a bunch of annotation that can be used to attach a label to test. All the annotations can be used on both class and method level. It is also possible to override class-level label on a method-level. There is one generic annotation, and a few bespoke ones that don't require label name:
- `@Priority`
- `@JiraReference`
- `@TestLabel` - the generic one.

There is also a Java API to attach labels during test execution. The `Label` class has a static method that can be used to attach a label. 

Here is a sample:
```java
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.annotation.JiraReference;
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.annotation.Priority;
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.annotation.TestLabel;
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.registrar.Label;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class AwesomeTests {

    @Test
    @Priority(Priority.P1)
    @JiraReference("ZBR-1231")
    @TestLabel(name = "app", value = {"reporting-service:v1.0", "reporting-service:v1.1"})
    public void awesomeTest() {
        // some code here  
        Label.attach("Chrome", "85.0");
        // meaningful assertions
    }

}
```
The test from sample above attaches 5 labels: 1 priority, 1 jira-reference, 2 app, 1 Chrome label.

The values of attached labels will be displayed in Zebrunner under the name of corresponding test. The values of the `@JiraReference` annotation will be displayed in blue pills to the right of the test name.

### Tracking test maintainer
You might want to add transparency to the process of automation maintenance by having an engineer responsible for evolution of specific tests or test classes.
Zebrunner comes with a concept of maintainer - a person that can be assigned to maintain tests. In order to keep track of those, agent comes with `@Maintainer` annotation.

This annotation can be placed on both test class and method. It is also possible to override class-level maintainer on a method-level. If a base test class is marked with this annotation, all child classes will inherit the annotation unless they have explicitly specified one.

See a sample test class below:
```java
import com.zebrunner.agent.core.reporting.Maintainer;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

@Maintainer("kenobi")
public class AwesomeTests {

    @Test
    @Maintainer("skywalker")
    public void awesomeTest() {
        // meaningful assertions
    }

    @Test
    public void anotherAwesomeTest() {
        // meaningful assertions
    }


}
```

In the example above, `kenobi` will be reported as a maintainer of `anotherAwesomeTest` (class-level value taken into account), while `skywalker` will be reported as a maintainer of test `awesomeTest`.

The maintainer username should be valid Zebrunner username, otherwise it will be set to `anonymous`.
